### Continuous vs discrete data
Random variables are processes that generate data in an
experiment performed by sampling from a particular
population. The data that random variables produce can be
either discrete or continuous. In a rather straight-forward
use of terms, a random variable that produces discrete data
is called a **discrete random variable** and a random
variable that produces continuous data is called a
**continuous random variable**.

For example, consider the random variable $X$ defined as a
process that returns the body lengths in cm of rats drawn
from a **population** defined as all rats in the universe. A
sample from this random variable might look as follows:
$$
\boldsymbol{x} = (2.877970, 7.497241, 5.455286, 4.903578, 7.806955)
$$
Here, $X$ is clearly a continuous random variable because it
seems that any non-zero value can be obtained when sampling
from it.

As another example, consider the random variable $X$ defined
as a process that returns the number of neurons in a rat
cerebral cortex drawn from the same population as in the
previous example. A sample from this random variable might
look as follows:
$$
\boldsymbol{x} = (21e6 21e6 18e6 20e6 22e6)
$$
Here, $X$ is clearly a discrete random variable because that
only integer values can be obtained when sampling from it.
