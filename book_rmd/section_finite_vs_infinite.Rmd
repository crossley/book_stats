## Finite vs Infinite
Populations and sample spaces can be composed of either
finite or infinite sets.  In another rather staight-forward
use of terms, they are finite if they contain a finite
number of things and they are called infinite if they
contain an infinite number of things. 

For example, the population of all neurons in a particular
human brain is finite because -- while there are certainly a
lot of them -- their number is finite.   As a more
tradtiional example, the sample space of rolling a six-sided
die is finite, consisting of just six possible outcomes: {1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

In contrast, the population of times a specific neuron
generates an action potential after stimulus onset is
infinite. To see this consider simply consider the number of
possible times that exist between 1.0 and 1.1 seconds. It
could be 1.01, 1.001, 1.0001, and so on. No matter how small
you make an increment, you can always make another increment
smaller than the last. This leads to infinity.
